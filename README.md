   ```

2. Set the Azure subscription:

   ```bash
   az account set --subscription <subscription-id>
   ```

3. Navigate to the project directory.

4. Publish the Blazor WebAssembly app:

   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```

5. Navigate to the publish directory:

   ```bash
   cd bin/Release/net5.0/publish
   ```

6. Create an Azure App Service:

   ```bash
   az webapp up --sku F1 --name <app-name> --location <location>
   ```

7. Deploy the ASP.NET Core Web API to Azure App Service:

   ```bash
   az webapp deploy --name <app-name> --src-path <path-to-api-publish-folder> --type zip
   ```

8. Once the deployment is complete, you can access the application at `https://<app-name>.azurewebsites.net`.
